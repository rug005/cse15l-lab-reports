# Lab Report 2

Part 1.


Part 2.
- A failure-inducing input I found in Lab 3 would be inside the file LectureExamples.java. I noticed that method sumEvebIndices has a
bug that would not add the evens correctly.
- An input that doesn't include a failure as a JUnit test can be seen in Tester ArrayTest.java. When the input in testReversed is null there is no way to detect if there's an error with the reverse method.

Part 3. After doing lab 2 and 3 I felt that I was able to learn more about how to start a web server using Github Desktop, and VSCode. My understanding of github has also improved.
